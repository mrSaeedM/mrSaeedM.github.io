I work as Data Science consultant for several startup companies. My background is in applied mathematics. I specialized in systems biology/pharmacology modeling during my PhD. Later in my job, I learned how to apply statistical inference techniques to (mitochondrial) genome-wide association studies focusing on cancer and healthy aging. I also work on building ML models for medical applications and Decision Support Systems.
