My background is in applied mathematics. I specialized in systems biology modeling during my PhD. Later I did research on machine learning applications in genomics.

**Systems biology approach to sensory adaptation**
Check out my Phd Thesis "In pursuit of mathematical principles in systems biology" [PDF](https://research.tue.nl/files/92435580/20180313_Masroor.pdf)

Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this my are inspired by a biological behavior
called sensory adaptation. We can briefly define it as the continuous recalibration of biological sensors as a response to the changes in their environment. I explore the capabilities of different classes of biochemical reaction
networks in showing sensory adaptation. Under certain constraints on the
structure and thermodynamics of these biochemical reactions, I prove that
the functionality is limited. I prove that those limitations can ba characterized by properties of the graph of the reactions. I further show how
relaxing the constraints allows these networks to exhibit arbitrarily strong
adaptation.

**Synthetic Biology**
Finding design principles in Synthetic biology is the subject of the Chapter 6
of my PhD thesis. I study a specific synthetic biology toolbox, called the PEN-DNA toolbox, which is used to make DNA-based circuits that
mimick the cellular signaling pathways. We find general design principles in
terms of mathematical theorems that shed light on the global properties of
the toolbox. I also analyze different ways of reducing the complexity of
the mathematical models of this toolbox.

**Systems Pharmacology**
Systems pharmacology, the quantitative and data integrated approach to the
study of the interaction of body with drugs, is the subject of the Chapter 7 of
my thesis. We deal with the mathematical modeling, fitting, and interpreting of clinical trial data related to the blood glucose regulation in human subjects.
We study the effect a new drug on the number of the glucagon receptors in
the liver as well as its effect on the action of the hormone glucagon in blood
glucose regulation.
