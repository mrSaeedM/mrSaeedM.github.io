My background is in applied mathematics. I specialized in systems biology modeling during my PhD. After that I did research on machine learning applications in genomics.

**Better ways to perform mitochondrial DNA association studies**

I study the variations in the mitochondrial genome. I am interested in determining the pathogenicity of mtDNA variants and their role in the etiology of chronic disease, cancer treatment, and healthy aging. I am developing methods to perform Genome-Wide Association Studies for mitochondrial DNA. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, such as haplogroup association studies that are underpowered to detect subtle changes when dealing with a moderate sample size.

**Systems biology approach to sensory adaptation**

Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this my are inspired by a biological behavior
called sensory adaptation. We can briefly define it as the continuous recalibration of biological sensors as a response to the changes in their environment. I explore the capabilities of different classes of biochemical reaction
networks in showing sensory adaptation. Under certain constraints on the
structure and thermodynamics of these biochemical reactions, I prove that
the functionality is limited. I prove that those limitations can ba characterized by properties of the graph of the reactions. I further show how
relaxing the constraints allows these networks to exhibit arbitrarily strong
adaptation.

**Synthetic Biology**

Finding design principles in Synthetic biology is the subject of the Chapter 6
of my PhD thesis. I study a specific synthetic biology toolbox, called the PEN-DNA toolbox, which is used to make DNA-based circuits that
mimick the cellular signaling pathways. We find general design principles in
terms of mathematical theorems that shed light on the global properties of
the toolbox. I also analyze different ways of reducing the complexity of
the mathematical models of this toolbox.

**Systems Pharmacology**

Systems pharmacology, the quantitative and data integrated approach to the
study of the interaction of body with drugs, is the subject of the Chapter 7 of
my thesis. We deal with the mathematical modeling, fitting, and interpreting of clinical trial data related to the blood glucose regulation in human subjects.
We study the effect a new drug on the number of the glucagon receptors in
the liver as well as its effect on the action of the hormone glucagon in blood
glucose regulation.
